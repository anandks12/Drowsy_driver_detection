## Drowsy Driver Detection

## Overview
This real-time driver drowsiness detection system uses deep learning with OpenCV and Mediapipe Face Mesh. The system calculates the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) and Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR) for drowsiness detection. Integrated with a QT-based GUI, the system provides a user-friendly interface for real-time monitoring. The solution is computationally efficient, requiring no expensive hardware, and works well in low-light conditions, such as night-time driving.
